# CongestionSim
Congestion control evalutation
In order to perform senstivity analysis of the congestion control, we use a modified bin-packing algorithm that is evaluated in the code. 
Certain features like receive window limitations and Head of Line blocking will be examined in the future.

The modified bin-packing produces new request buffers dynamically. The heuristics works in the best-fit manner.
